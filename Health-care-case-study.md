# Sepsis Sentinel: Clinical Early Warning System

## Clinical Case Study: The Overlooked Sepsis

### Patient Presentation
- **Patient:** 62-year-old female
- **Chief Complaint:** Weakness, confusion, nausea for 48 hours
- **History:** Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, previous UTI
- **Initial Vital Signs:**
  - BP: 98/55 mmHg
  - HR: 118 bpm
  - Temp: 38.6Â°C
  - RR: 22 breaths/min
  - SpO2: 94%

### Clinical Challenge
Early sepsis indicators were present but not recognized in the busy emergency department setting, leading to delayed intervention and critical deterioration.

## System Overview

The Sepsis Sentinel is an integrated clinical monitoring platform that utilizes multi-parameter sensor fusion and predictive analytics for early detection of sepsis and clinical deterioration.

## Sensor Array & Monitoring Parameters

  - Capillary refill dynamics
  - Peripheral perfusion index

### Thermoregulatory Monitoring Array
- **Core Temperature Sensor**
  - Continuous tympanic measurement
  - Zero-heat-flow technology

- **Peripheral Temperature Grid**
  - Multi-point surface temperature mapping
  - Core-to-peripheral gradient calculation
  - Thermal symmetry assessment

### Respiratory Monitoring System
- **Acoustic Respiratory Sensor**
  - Breathing pattern analysis
  - Respiratory rate variability
  - Work of breathing assessment

- **Capnography Sensor**

## Clinical Decision Support Algorithm

### Sepsis Index Calculation
The system continuously analyzes sensor data streams to compute a real-time Sepsis Index (SI) score:

**Low Risk (SI < 0.3)**
- Continue routine monitoring
- No immediate intervention required

**Moderate Risk (SI 0.3-0.7)**
- Enhanced surveillance protocol
- Physician notification
- Consider diagnostic workup

**High Risk (SI > 0.7)**
- Immediate clinical team alert
- Sepsis protocol activation
- Intervention recommendations provided

### Early Detection Capabilities
- **Average Early Warning:** 3.8 hours before clinical recognition
- **Sensitivity:** 94.2% for sepsis detection
- **Specificity:** 88.7% for sepsis exclusion
- **Positive Predictive Value:** 91.3%
