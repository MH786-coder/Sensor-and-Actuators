# 🩺 MediSense: Intelligent Patient Monitoring & Care System

A comprehensive, sensor-driven IoT platform designed to automate and enhance patient care in clinical and home environments.

---

## 🏥 Overview

MediSense is an integrated healthcare automation system that leverages a network of advanced **sensors** and **actuators** to provide real-time patient monitoring and automated responses. The system is designed to reduce the workload on healthcare professionals, minimize human error, and ensure immediate intervention during critical events, thereby improving patient outcomes and safety.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The MediSense ecosystem is built on a three-tier architecture for robust and efficient operation:

1.  **Perception Layer:** The physical layer comprising sensors and actuators attached to the patient and the environment.
2.  **Network Layer:** The communication bridge that transmits data from the perception layer to the processing unit using various wireless protocols.
3.  **Application Layer:** The central hub for data processing, analysis, storage, and triggering automated actuator responses or user alerts.

## 📡 Sensors Used

MediSense employs a suite of non-invasive and ambient sensors to gather comprehensive patient data.

| Sensor | Measured Parameter | Application Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Thermistor** 🌡️ | Body Temperature | Continuous fever monitoring; detects hypothermia. |
| **Pulse Oximeter** ❤️ | Heart Rate (BPM) & Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂) | Monitoring for arrhythmias or sudden drops in oxygen levels. |
| **Piezo-Resistive Sensor** 📏 | Blood Pressure (NIBP) | Automated, scheduled non-invasive blood pressure readings. |
| **Accelerometer/Gyroscope** 🚶 | Patient Motion & Posture | Fall detection for elderly patients; bed exit alerts. |
| **Pressure Mat Sensor** 🛏️ | Bed Occupancy & Movement | Monitors restlessness and sleep patterns without contact. |
| **Air Flow Sensor** 💨 | Respiration Rate | Detects apnea or irregular breathing patterns. |
| **ECG Electrodes** 🫀 | Electrical Heart Activity | Detailed cardiac monitoring for ICU/post-operative patients. |
| **Ambient Light & Sound** 🔊 | Room Environment | Automatically adjusts lighting for patient comfort. |

## 🔁 Actuators Used

Actuators are the "muscles" of the MediSense system, converting electronic commands into physical actions.

| Actuator | Function | Application Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Servo Motor** ⚙️ | Precise angular movement. | Automatically adjusts bed incline for patient comfort or clinical need. |
| **Peristaltic Pump** 💉 | Controlled fluid delivery. | Administers IV medication or nutrients based on a programmed schedule. |
| **Solenoid Valve** 🚰 | Controls liquid/gas flow. | Manages oxygen flow rate from a central supply to a patient mask. |
| **Piezo Buzzer & LED** 🚨 | Audible and visual alerts. | Triggers a local alarm for critical events like a fall or cardiac anomaly. |
| **Relay Module** 🔌 | Switches high-power devices. | Automatically turns on/off medical equipment like an air compressor. |
| **Smart Display** 📺 | Visual data presentation. | Shows real-time vitals on a bedside monitor for staff and patients. |

## 🔬 Working Principle

The core of MediSense is the seamless, automated loop between sensing and action.

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sensors continuously collect physiological and environmental data.
2.  **Signal Conditioning:** Raw analog signals are filtered, amplified, and converted to digital values by an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**.
3.  **Data Transmission:** The digitized data is sent to the central **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)** via wired (I2C, SPI) or short-range wireless (Bluetooth) links.
4.  **Processing & Analysis:** The MCU runs algorithms to analyze the data stream. It compares readings against pre-defined **thresholds** (e.g., SpO₂ < 90%, heart rate > 120 BPM).
5.  **Decision & Command:** If a threshold is breached, the MCU executes a pre-programmed logic.
6.  **Actuation:** The MCU sends a command signal to the appropriate actuator(s).
    *   *Example:* If the pulse oximeter detects low SpO₂, the MCU commands the **solenoid valve** to increase oxygen flow and triggers the **buzzer** to alert nearby staff.
7.  **Feedback:** The system can use data from other sensors to confirm the action was successful, creating a closed-loop control system.

## 🌐 Communication Technologies

A hybrid approach ensures reliable data transfer across different ranges and power requirements.

*   **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** Used for short-range, low-power communication between wearable sensors and the bedside **Gateway**.
*   **Wi-Fi:** Connects the gateway and stationary sensors to the local network for high-speed data transfer to the central server and cloud.
*   **Zigbee:** Forms a low-power, self-healing mesh network for numerous environmental sensors (motion, light, door) throughout a ward.
*   **LoRaWAN:** Provides long-range, low-power connectivity for asset tracking (e.g., wheelchairs, portable monitors) across a large hospital campus.

## 🧩 Hardware Components

*   **Microcontroller (MCU):** ESP32 / ARM Cortex-M series (for processing and connectivity).
*   **Sensors:** As listed in the Sensors section.
*   **Actuators:** As listed in the Actuators section.
*   **Gateway Device:** A single-board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi) that aggregates data from multiple MCUs.
*   **Power Management:** Battery packs for portability, with AC power for stationary units.
