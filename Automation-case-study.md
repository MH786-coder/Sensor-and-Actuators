## 🧠 Scenario Summary
**Organization:** NovaTech Engineering Pvt. Ltd., Pune, India  
**Industry:** Heavy Equipment Manufacturing  
**Duration:** 14-Month Pilot Implementation  
**Production Lines Automated:** 8 Assembly & CNC Units  
**Technology Stack:** Smart Sensors, PLC Controllers, Edge AI, SCADA Integration, Cloud Analytics  

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
NovaTech’s traditional production process heavily depended on manual supervision and reactive maintenance. Key issues included:
- Unplanned downtime due to undetected mechanical wear  
- Inconsistent product quality caused by temperature and vibration fluctuations  
- Inefficient power consumption patterns  
- Lack of centralized visibility into real-time machine performance  

These challenges led to **26% productivity loss** and **high maintenance overheads** annually.

## 💡 Solution Implementation
The **AutoSense Architecture** was deployed across all critical production zones. It operates through **four intelligent layers** ensuring continuous monitoring and adaptive automation.

### 1. **Sensing Layer**
Each machine was equipped with **high-precision industrial sensors**, including:
- **Vibration Sensors:** Detect mechanical imbalance or bearing degradation  
- **Thermal Sensors:** Monitor overheating in motors and hydraulic systems  
- **Proximity Sensors:** Ensure accurate positioning in robotic arms  
- **Current Sensors:** Track abnormal electrical loads in CNC machinery  

### 2. **Edge Processing Layer**
Data from sensors were transmitted via **Modbus and MQTT protocols** to **Edge AI gateways**, which performed:
- Noise filtration and data normalization  
- On-site anomaly prediction (reducing latency)  
- Secure communication to central cloud analytics  

### 3. **Automation & Control Layer**
Based on real-time analytics, the PLC systems executed automated actions:
- Adjusting spindle speed to prevent overheating  
- Stopping conveyor belts on sensor-detected misalignment  
- Activating backup power units during overload conditions  

### 4. **Analytics & Visualization Layer**
A **SCADA-integrated dashboard** provided:
- Live visualization of all sensor parameters  
- AI-based predictive maintenance alerts  
- Energy usage trend analysis per unit  

**Example:**  
When a lathe machine’s vibration exceeded 8.2 mm/s, the AI engine predicted potential bearing failure and automatically scheduled a maintenance slot — **24 hours before** any operational breakdown occurred.
