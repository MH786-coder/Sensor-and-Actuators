## 🔬 Working Principle

The core operation follows a precise **sense-process-actuate** cycle:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Sensors continuously monitor environmental parameters and convert physical phenomena into electrical signals
2. **Signal Conditioning**: Raw analog signals are filtered and converted to digital format via ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
3. **Data Processing**: The microcontroller runs control algorithms comparing sensor data against predefined setpoints
4. **Decision Making**: Based on programmed logic, the controller determines necessary actions
5. **Command Execution**: Control signals are sent to appropriate actuators
6. **Feedback Verification**: Subsequent sensor readings confirm the action's effectiveness, creating closed-loop control

*Example: Temperature Control System*
- **Sensor** detects room temperature rising above 25°C
- **Controller** processes this data and determines cooling is needed
- **Actuator** activates the AC compressor via relay
- **Feedback** from temperature sensor confirms temperature decrease
